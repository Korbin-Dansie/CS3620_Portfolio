<h2>Hi, I'm Korbin Dansie</h2>
<h1>I am an computer engineer, alway eager to learn more.</h1>
<p>I found my love of programming back in high school. When I so innocently decided to take just one programming course. After that, I was hooked. I then began pursuing a bachelor's degree in software engineering.</p>
